# TidyText_Demo
This demo has been created by Cara Anderson, Sarah Hebert, and Nicole Major for a Virginia Tech Capstone project.
It uses a subset (40 reviews) of an IMDB dataset (link found at the bottom) to conduct foundational sentiment analysis. 
This is by no means all-inclusive, but allows for an overview on how to use TidyText.

For more information on TidyText go to:

For access to the entire IMDB Dataset (over 50,000 reviews) go to:
